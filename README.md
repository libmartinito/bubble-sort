# Bubble Sort

This is an an attempt at implementing the bubble sort algorithm.

## Overview

### The challenge

One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

A method called bubble_sort should be built that takes an array and returns a sorted array using the bubble sort methodology.

## My Process

### Built with

- Ruby

### What I Learned

I learned about the syntax of loops, conditionals, and arrays in Ruby.

### Continued development

I am interested in developing a front end for this piece of logic with new tools and frameworks as I learn them.

### Useful resources

- [Array documentation of Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.3/Array.html)
